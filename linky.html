    <p> The fungus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis">Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</a>,
	more commmonly known as "zombie-ant fungus" survives in tropical ecosystems by infecting ants.<br> The host exhibits
	behavioral changes, causing convulsions that drop them from their nest for the forest floor which is suited for fungal growth. <br>
	The lifecycle finishes by the ant climbing onto a leaf, clamping down (death clamp), and dying.</p>
