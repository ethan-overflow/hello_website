    <h1><strong>Favorite Foods</strong></h1>
	<p>Growing up, my favorite foods all had noodles involved. I don't know
	why this is, but they do taste good. Mexican food is also highly-rated.</p>
	
	<h1><strong>Favorite Bands</strong></h1>
	<p>There is one band that been on my mind recently, so much so that
	over the summer I impulse-bought an electric guitar...<em>Polyphia</em>.
	I love technical and virtuostic guitar playing, but I also like many more
	low-key bands.
